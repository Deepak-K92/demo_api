# demo_api

Flutter app where we send and recieve data in the XML format.

## Getting Started

* This is a project where need to fetch data from the server with a POST method by giving dynamic values from the user.
* This will in turn give the response in XML format.
* We have to parse the XML format(response) into DATA CLASSES.
* The architecture used is CLEAN ARCHITECTURE.
* Used BLOC as STATE MANAGEMENT.
* Create Custom Widgets.
* Display dynamic location in GOOGLE MAPS.
* When pressed on CALL it should redirect to DIALER.
* Use validations for USERNAME and PASSWORD where the entries should not be of more than 30 characters.
